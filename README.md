# Nonlinear-Stokes-Flow-in-FEniCS

FEniCS code used for

  S. Jimenez, J.N. Bassis, R. Duddu, “An updated-Lagrangian damage mechanics formulation for modeling the creeping flow and fracture of ice sheets” Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 313: 406-432, 2017, doi: [10.1016/j.cma.2016.09.034][1]
  
and distributed at [Dr. Ravindra Duddu's web page][2]

This project will explore the possibility of extending this code to non-local plasticity (and damage?) for tectonic modeling.
